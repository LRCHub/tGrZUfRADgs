```
느껴봐
Something in the air tonight
빛이 나
다신 오지 않을 이 순간
붙잡고
애써봐야 time is passing by
Let it go
We gon' lose the track of time
Put your hands up, party
해 뜰 때까지 다 move
Body body
All day
Better make some room
여기로 모여
That roller coaster
Ready to go ya ya ya ya
뜨겁게 더
Risin'
Heat it up 가빠지는 숨
Everybody
All day
Better make some room
여기로 모여
That roller coaster
Ready to go ya ya ya ya
One more time
Wanna get lost in the ni-ni-night
틀어줘 song that I li-li-like
Come on just dance with me now
Dance with me now
미쳐봐
마지막인 것처럼 one last time
Finally here I'm ali-li-live
Come on just dance with me now
Dance with me now
(What's up pretty)
I found you looking for a man in your life
You told me love's a drug
I'm pickin' you up, we 'bout to get drunk
Let me cater to you tonight
See you in my frame this Cartier can't handle
you
Cuz your light is too bright
하면 하는 내 성격은 impulsive
Verse가 끝나기도 전에 we're dancing in the light
Like this swing it left to right 우린 합을 맞추
지
She call me papi, yeah I like it 할래 너와 나쁜
짓
We're too legit
보고 배워 우리 둘의 fit
They can't counterfeit
어딜 가든 튀지 미친 시너지
Put your hands up, party
해 뜰 때까지 다 move
Body body
All day
Better make some room
여기로 모여
That roller coaster
Ready to go ya ya ya ya
뜨겁게 더
Risin'
Heat it up 가빠지는 숨
Everybody
All day
Better make some room
여기로 모여
That roller coaster
Ready to go ya ya ya ya
One more time
Wanna get lost in the ni-ni-night
틀어줘 song that I li-li-like
Come on just dance with me now
Dance with me now
미쳐봐
마지막인 것처럼 one last time
Finally here I'm ali-li-live
Come on just dance with me now
Dance with me now
On replay
Baby play it one more time, I might just stay,
yeah
눈빛으로 말해, ain't gotta say it
Feel the tide yeah 파도 위에
Wait, you sure you could keep up?
You sure you could keep up?
Dance with me now
