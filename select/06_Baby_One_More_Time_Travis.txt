Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight
Show me what you want it to be
Tell me baby cos I need to know now because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
If I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you
Girl you got me blind
Oh pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby cos I need to know now because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
If I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe that you will be here
Just give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
If I'm not with you I lose my mind Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
