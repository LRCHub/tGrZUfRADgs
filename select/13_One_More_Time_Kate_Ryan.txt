Twisting and turning
My dreams into play
I want to bring my light out of the shade

Burning and bleeding
As time slips away
You only leave me with one thing to say

Tell me one more time
That you'll leave those days behind
Tell me one more time
That it's me who's on your mind
Maybe I'm over complicated
But I'm for real and I can't fake it
I've given more than anyone can take
Tell me one more time...

Living and learning
By all the rules gone by
There's more to me and you than meets the eye

Hiding and seeking
From all that gave us life
Been down this road before just once or twice

Tell me one more time
That you'll leave those days behind
Tell me one more time
That it's me who's on your mind
Maybe I'm over complicated
But I'm for real and I can't fake it
I've given more than anyone can take
Tell me one more time...

Tell me one more time
That you'll leave those days behind
Tell me one more time
That it's me who's on your mind
Tell me one more time
That you'll leave those days behind
Tell me one more time
That it's me who's on your mind
Tell me one more time...
