I never meant to hurt you
Didn't mean to do you wrong
I guess I never learned to
Cherish love 'til it was gone
And then by chance to meet you
Bringing back the memories
I realised I need you
Could you ever come on back to me

Baby, baby, baby
I know that we can make it

Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time

Didn't know 'til I saw you
We've been apart for much too long
How my heart still beats for you
Oh, my love is growing strong

Baby, baby, baby
I know that we can make it

Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time

Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time

Baby, baby, baby
I know that we can make it

Let me love you one more time
One more chance to make it right
I could make you change your mind
Let me love you one more time
