One more time
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
24-7, I will make you feel like heaven
I'll turn you upside down
I'll spin you round and round
I'll put a spell on you baby
I will make you come and play me
I'm gonna make you mine
Let's do it one more time
You spin me round and round and
Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and
Hit me to the feeling
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
Play me, play me, baby
Play me, show me what you got
Come play me, play me, baby
Play me, don't stop, don't stop
Do it, just do it, let's do it, again, again
Keep it going on, show no shame
Come and play the game
How did I know that I would do this to you
Now that I've made you mine
Let's do it one more time
You spin me round and round and
Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and
Hit me to the feeling
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
Play me, play me, baby
Play me, show me what you got
Come play me, play me, baby
Play me, don't stop, don't stop
You spin me round and round and
Turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and
Hit me to the feeling
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
Play me, play me baby
Play me, show me what you got
Come play me, play me baby
Play me, don't stop, don't stop
